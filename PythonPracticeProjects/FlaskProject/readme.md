A practice project where i followed the tutorial on https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-web-application-using-flask-and-deploy-it-to-the-cloud-3551c985e492/

Main purpose of this was to learn how to start using Flask

I did not create the virtual environment or deploy to a google server. Up to date virtual environment instructions are here https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
